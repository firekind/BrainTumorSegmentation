# End to End System to Discover Brain Tumors for Medical Diagnosis
This repository contains the deep learning models for the project. 

The model is based on the paper [3D MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation using Autoencoder Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11654)

Credits goes to the original authors of the paper.
